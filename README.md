# GroupKFold
sklearn's group kfold does not enable us to shuffle so I have rewritten one here. Main group kfold function adapted from here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41859613/how-to-obtain-reproducible-but-distinct-instances-of-groupkfold

I've included hyperparameter search and train and evaluation for a random forest for the sake of example.
